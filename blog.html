        We hereby release to the public “2GEDA” <a href="https://www.2geda.ng">https://www.2geda.ng</a>. An economy
        platform built on social, commerce and business to inherently amplify
        anyone's ability to earn a steady income that is cheap to operate,
        economically viable, sustainable, and accessible to anyone with a
        smartphone. On Wednesday the 14th of December 2022, in the bustling city
        of Lagos Nigeria.

        According to the Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria unemployment rate is at
        33.3% and in Africa, over 500 million people between the ages of 15 - 45
        years do not have a sustainable income, due to economic recessions, high
        inflation rate, among others. In Nigeria, the minimum wage is 25% lower
        than the price of essentials goods. It is predicted that the Africa's
        population is expected to grow to 2.5 billion people by 2050 with
        Nigeria being the center of this growth as compared to the 1.4 billion
        people presently and if sustainable solutions and opportunities are not
        created now, poverty will tremendously increase. Hence, the introduction
        of 2GEDA.

        An adage in Yoruba would say “Ise logun ise”, this means, work is the
        medicine for poverty. <a href="https://www.2geda.ng">https://www.2geda.ng</a> is the medicine. We are an
        organized trading marketplace that employs and pays its users to
        facilitate the buying and selling of groceries and produce via a
        smartphone.
